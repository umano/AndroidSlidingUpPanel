Android Sliding Up Panel
=========================

This library provides a simple way to add a draggable sliding up panel (popularized by Google Music, Google Maps and Rdio) to your Android application. Umano Team <3 Open Source.

As seen in [Umano](http://umanoapp.com) [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sothree.umano):

### Importing the library

#### Eclipse 

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel/releases) and include the `library` project as a dependency in Eclipse.

#### Android Studio 

Simply add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file to use the latest version:

```groovy
dependencies {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    compile 'com.sothree.slidinguppanel:library:3.0.0'
}
```

### Usage 

* Include `com.sothree.slidinguppanel.SlidingUpPanelLayout` as the root element in your activity layout.
* The layout must have `gravity` set to either `top` or `bottom`.
* Make sure that it has two children. The first child is your main layout. The second child is your layout for the sliding up panel.
* The main layout should have the width and the height set to `match_parent`.
* The sliding layout should have the width set to `match_parent` and the height set to either `match_parent`, `wrap_content` or the max desireable height.
* By default, the whole panel will act as a drag region and will intercept clicks and drag events. You can restrict the drag area to a specific view by using the `setDragView` method or `umanoDragView` attribute. 

For more information, please refer to the sample code.

```xml
<com.sothree.slidinguppanel.SlidingUpPanelLayout
    xmlns:sothree="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/sliding_layout"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:gravity="bottom"
    sothree:umanoPanelHeight="68dp"
    sothree:umanoShadowHeight="4dp">

    <TextView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:gravity="center"
        android:text="Main Content"
        android:textSize="16sp" />

    <TextView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:gravity="center|top"
        android:text="The Awesome Sliding Up Panel"
        android:textSize="16sp" />
</com.sothree.slidinguppanel.SlidingUpPanelLayout>
```
For smooth interaction with the ActionBar, make sure that `windowActionBarOverlay` is set to `true` in your styles:
```xml
<style name="AppTheme">
    <item name="android:windowActionBarOverlay">true</item>
</style>
```
However, in this case you would likely want to add a top margin to your main layout of `?android:attr/actionBarSize`
or `?attr/actionBarSize` to support older API versions.

### Caveats, Additional Features and Customization

* If you are using a custom `umanoDragView`, the panel will pass through the click events to the main layout. Make your second layout `clickable` to prevent this.
* You can change the panel height by using the `setPanelHeight` method or `umanoPanelHeight` attribute.
* If you would like to hide the shadow above the sliding panel, set `shadowHeight` attribute to 0.
* Use `setEnabled(false)` to completely disable the sliding panel (including touch and programmatic sliding)
* Use `setTouchEnabled(false)` to disables panel's touch responsiveness (drag and click), you can still control the panel programatically
* Use `getPanelState` to get the current panel state
* Use `setPanelState` to set the current panel state
* You can add paralax to the main view by setting `umanoParalaxOffset` attribute (see demo for the example).
* You can set a anchor point in the middle of the screen using `setAnchorPoint` to allow an intermediate expanded state for the panel (similar to Google Maps).
* You can set a `PanelSlideListener` to monitor events about sliding panes.
* You can also make the panel slide from the top by changing the `layout_gravity` attribute of the layout to `top`.
* By default, the panel pushes up the main content. You can make it overlay the main content by using `setOverlayed` method or `umanoOverlay` attribute. This is useful if you would like to make the sliding layout semi-transparent. You can also set `umanoClipPanel` to false to make the panel transparent in non-overlay mode.
* By default, the main content is dimmed as the panel slides up. You can change the dim color by changing `umanoFadeColor`. Set it to `"@android:color/transparent"` to remove dimming completely.

### Implementation

This library was initially based on the opened-sourced [SlidingPaneLayout](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/SlidingPaneLayout.html) component from the r13 of the Android Support Library. Thanks Android team!

### Requirements

Tested on Android 2.2+
